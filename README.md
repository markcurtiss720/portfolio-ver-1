# portfolio-ver-1

## Description

A portfoio to house all my projects and show future employers what I am capable of. I built this to test my skills in html and css and to have a place to list any and all projects I've worked on. Future employers can view my work and see if my skills are what they are needing.



## Usage

When you select a link on the nav bar

![Navbar selection](assets/images/select-on-nav-bar.png)

it will jump you to that section on the web page.

![Selected section](assets/images/go-to-selected-section.png)

selecting the name of the project in the work section

![Work project](assets/images/select-work-project.png)

it will open in a new tab that particular project.
